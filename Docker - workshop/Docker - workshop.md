# Day 2

## Preparation
* Install docker desktop

## Workshop notes
* Talked about docker file basic commands. The video has not been recorded

### Entrypoint vs Cmd

```
# shell form
# When instruction is executed in shell form it calls /bin/sh -c
<command>
# under the hood and normal shell processing happens.
# <instruction> <command>
```
```
# exec form
# When instruction is executed in exec form it calls executable
directly,
# and shell processing does not happen
# <instruction> ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...]
```
```
FROM debian:sid-slim
RUN echo "Hello world"
CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]
```
```
FROM debian:sid-slim
RUN echo "Hello world"
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]
```
CMD sets DEFAULT command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.
ENTRYPOINT configures a container that will run as an executable.

We can use them both
```
FROM debian:sid-slim
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello"]
CMD ["world"]
```

```
FROM debian:sid-slim
# environment variable. Set there or change on docker RUN
ENV mood happy

# parametras panaudojamas, nes naudojame bash,
# taciau tokiu stiliumi NEGALIMA nieko paduot is vartotojo

# pvz: docker run demo-3 "Valentinas" -> I feel really happy today!
ENTRYPOINT echo "I feel really $mood today!"

# pvz: docker run demo-3 "Valentinas" -> I feel really $mood today!
Valentinas
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "I feel really $mood today!"]

# pvz: docker run demo-3 "Valentinas" -> I feel really happy today!
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo I feel really $mood today!"]

# pvz: docker run demo-3 "Valentinas" -> I feel really $mood today!
Valentinas
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo I feel really $mood today!"]
CMD ["word"]
# Naudojame juos kartu
# veikia ir su ir be parametro. kodel? $0 priima parametra.
# kas butu jeigu CMD nebutu arba nepaduociau parametro kviesdamas?
# shell form
ENTRYPOINT /bin/echo "I feel really $mood today! $0"
CMD [""]

# exec form
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/bin/echo \"I feel really $mood today!
$0\""]
CMD [""]
Can I replace env variable value?
docker run -e mood="bad" demo "Valentinas"
# set env variable on docker BUILD you need to use ARG: --build-arg
# you could give this a default value as well
ARG mood_arg=happy
ENV mood=$mood_arg

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/bin/echo \"I feel really $mood today!
$0\""]
CMD [""]
```

# Day 3

## Preparation
* Install docker desktop

## Workshop notes
If you want to run a python flask application you can use python:3.10 and python:3.10-slim-buster. The slim version will be size
optimized so if you have everything you need in your requirements, use the slim version instead.

```
# FROM python:3.10-slim-buster
FROM python:3.10

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

## Post exercises
Run new webapp --no-https
* Create a docker file for this project
* Create docker commands to run and access this project started from docker locally
