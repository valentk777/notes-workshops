# Workshop â€“ Docker (Docker CLI + Docker File)
* Level: Medium
* Language: Lithuanian + English
* Speaker: [Valentinas Kaminskas](https://github.com/valentk777)

There are two folders. One for the Docker CLI part and a general idea of how the Docker works. And second one is for the Docker file syntax, tips, and tricks, and differences between multiple commands. 

Docker CLI will be used in the DockerFile part so participants should know about it at least something. So it is better to start from DockerCLI and then move to the DockerFile part if possible.
